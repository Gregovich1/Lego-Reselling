                    <h3>Benefits</h3>
                    <p>The main benefits for you come in two forms: Lego VIP points and shopping portal rewards. I will explain each of these briefly here and include more details in the 
                        <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ.</a>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Lego VIP Points</h4>
                    <img src="images/LEGO-VIP-Benefits.png" alt="Lego VIP Benefits">
                    <p>VIP points are pretty easy to understand. When you buy Legos at the Lego Store,
                            you earn rewards points. You get a $5 reward for every 100 VIP points. There are occasional events where you earn double points. We will leverage 
                        that as much as possible.</p>
                    <p>With your VIP points, you can buy Christmas gifts. If you somehow do not have a Lego-loving friend in your life, you can sell the points to me. 
                        I will simply buy your free items at face value.</p>
                    <h4>Shopping Portal Rewards</h4>
                    <p>With nearly any online purchase, you have the opportunity to earn cash back, airline miles, or bank points by "clicking through" a website known as a portal.
                        Unfortunately, the portals are not very generous on Lego purchases. Cash back is usually 2-5% and most airline portals offer 1-3 points per dollar. I always check Cashback Monitor
                        for the latest portal offers. Please note that portals can be annoying. Sometimes the orders do not properly track. Cashing out can also be a pain. I will do whatever I can to help guide you.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Other Benefits</h4>
                    <p>You will also get the benefit of increased spending on your credit card. This can be very valuable if you are trying to meet a minimum spending requirement for a welcome bonus.
                        Another benefit is that you may pick up some of my "ninja tricks" for saving money while shopping online. Maybe you will want to become a reseller yourself! However, you will have to find a different product.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Risks</h3>
                    <p>There aren't too many risks. I will reimburse you quickly for the products you order, so that you are willing to order more! If the Lego Store makes a mistake on your order
                        or it becomes damaged during shipping, you will have to deal with the return. As mentioned above, There is some risk with the shopping portal rewards.
