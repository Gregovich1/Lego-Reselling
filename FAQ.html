                    <dl>
                        <dt>Can I buy Legos and then sell them on my own?</dt>
                        <dd>You could and you would not be competing with me, but you cannot sell Lego sets the same way I do. I sell exclusively on Amazon, using FBA.
                            Amazon has brand restrictions in place, such that new sellers cannot begin selling certain brands such as Legos. You could sell Legos on eBay.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Is this legal? Will either of us get in trouble?</dt>
                        <dd>My business is legal. I have an established entity and pay taxes. There is nothing illegal about reselling goods.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Will I get banned by the Lego Store?</dt>
                        <dd>Maybe. Lego appears to allow multiple orders per day, but is known to cancel orders if you push too far. We will be careful to avoid a complete ban, because that would
                            mean forfeiting VIP points.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>How do these shopping portals work?</dt>
                        <dd>Shopping portals are a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing">affiliate marketing.</a>
                            They are getting paid to attract your business. Their business models and payout schemes vary. </dd>
